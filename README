 hfs 
=====

hfs is a very simple file server using HTTP.

 Installation
--------------

Install the Werkzeug and gevent Python modules, then create a folder called
"files".

 Notes
-------

If you are using Windows, you should change "/etc/mime.types" to "mime.types",
because

- Windows has no such file
- Windows' mime.types is broken.
